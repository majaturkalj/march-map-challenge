# march-map-challenge
I have a been participating in the Map A Month Challenge and this Web-Based GIS map is a part of this challenge.
I am new to web GIS and web development, so this my first attempt in creating this kind of map. 
I have been using HTML, CSS and Leafleat to create this simple map.
